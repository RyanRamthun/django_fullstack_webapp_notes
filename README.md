# Django Full-Stack To-Do App with User Functionality 

This to-do list like app uses the Django framework to create a good outline of what many full-stack web applications look like.
<br />
## Functionality:

* Ability for users to post notes to the home page that can be seen by all
* Ability for users to update and delete personal current notes
* Each user has their own personal profile web page
